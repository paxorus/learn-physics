<p>Promising beginnings: I first started recording my thoughts in the margins of my math notebooks. Then I decided to dedicate a notebook to just these 
ideas when one evening I grabbed a used notebook and brought it to a boring party to attempt the Binomial Theorem proof. I was unsuccessful. I derived 
several trigonometric identities to use in class and attempted a Pythagorean triple generator (getting into Pell's equations) while trying to prove that 
of a Pythagorean triple, one is always divisible by 3, one by 4, and one by 5. I wrote a paper on paradoxes for statistics. I made the Punnett shortcut 
for biology class. Precalculus (and the teacher's lack of comprehension) inspired my recursives formula and analysis of infinity. I used the rotation 
matrix transformation and others to angle parabolas, but a month later my exact processes and discoveries showed up in the regular curriculum. Although 
it was one of my proudest and most successful discoveries, I don't need to upload it because it can be found in any calculus BC book. I tragically lost 
my first two notebooks, so the above is from memory.

<p>Rougher tides: In 12th grade, I attempted the Rubik's cube and was successful until the third layer. I began messing around with derivative proofs 
while trying a few longer term projects: crushing a hemisphere, my triangle puzzle, a manual factor to graph intervals, followed by a long line of 
failures. I began the points-to-curve algorithm for the physics mousetrap lab and finding the bond angle of MX4 for chemistry. At some point I became
fascinated with e and ln(x) and proved all of the formulas that had shown up in calculus.

<p>A comeback: I compared area and volume formulas, stumbled upon fractional calculus, and worked out algorithms to simplify cosine and sine. A friend 
presented me with a Java program he had been trying to write for years, and by the end of the day I had four different solutions. I am now programming 
my points-to-curve algorithm while playing around with a cubic equation solver and proving rotational inertia formulas from physics, quite possibly
returning to the Binomial Theorem.

<div class="h2" id="pyth">Pythagorean Triples</div>
<div class="text">
My actual intention was to generate all possible Pythagorean triples, but I made the faulty assumption that for all base triples, the hypotenuse and
longer leg differed by only 1 or 2. Although the below does not account for all base triples, it still produces a triple for any shorter leg length x.
<br><br>The key was to notice that any odd number is the difference of two consecutive perfect squares. Of these odd numbers, the perfect squares
and their corresponding difference of squares will form a triple. Call the consecutive squares y<sup>2</sup> and (y+1)<sup>2</sup>, and the chosen
odd square x<sup>2</sup>. We know x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup>=(y+1)<sup>2</sup>, thus x<sup>2</sup>=2y+1. How about choosing x to be even?
Now the key is to note that the differences of the squares of some y<sup>2</sup> and (y+2)<sup>2</sup> form a sequence of multiples of 4. Of these
even numbers, all the even perfect squares occur in the sequence so as above, x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup>=(y+2)<sup>2</sup>, thus x<sup>2</sup>=4y+4.
So I had a function for the longer leg y in terms of the shorter leg x, depending on whether x was odd or even. I ran into Pell's equation when I
set the expressions for y equal after noticing that an even x and an odd x could produce the same y. For example, 7 and 10 both generated y=24.

<div class="h2" id="cor">The Reason Behind |r|<span>&#60;1</span></div>
<div class="text">
Infinity is undoubtedly one of the most recurring concepts in mathematics. It has its own genre of paradoxes; 
Galileo's paradox, Zeno's paradox, Hilbert's Hotel, and even the von Neumann paradox only scratched the surface of its wonder. 
In the Banach-Tarski paradox, a sphere is disassembled and reassembled into two spheres, each congruent to the original, using only simple rotations and translations! 
Here is a quick proof of the infinite sum <span>&#931;</span> of a geometric series equaling a<sub>1</sub>/(1-r).
<br>a<sub>1</sub>+a<sub>2</sub>+a<sub>3</sub>+...=<span>&#931;</span>
<br>a<sub>1</sub>+a<sub>1</sub>r+a<sub>1</sub>r^2+...=<span>&#931;</span>
<br>a<sub>1</sub>r+a<sub>1</sub>r^2+...=<span>&#931;</span>*r
<br>(a<sub>1</sub>+a<sub>1</sub>r+a<sub>1</sub>r^2+...)-(a<sub>1</sub>r+a<sub>1</sub>r^2+a<sub>1</sub>r^3...)=<span>&#931;-</span>&#931;*r
<br>a<sub>1</sub>=<span>&#931;-</span>&#931;*r
<br>a<sub>1</sub>=<span>&#931;</span>*(1-r)
<br>&#931;=a<sub>1</sub>/(1-r)
<br>Unfortunately, there's a restriction:|r|<span>&#60;</span>1. Does it make sense graphically? Let a<sub>1</sub>=6 arbitrarily and <span>&#931;</span> be a function of r.
f(r)=6/(1-r) is a hyperbola. 
We know the following: If r<span>&#8805;</span>1, the sum should diverge. 
If 1<span>&#60;</span>|r|<span>&#60;</span>0, the sum of the series should converge.
If r=0, <span>&#931;</span>=a<sub>1</sub>.
If r<span>&#8804;</span>-1, the series will alternate between positive and negative terms, diverging.
Instead the hyperbola only matches on the interval (-1,1).  
<br><br>So what assumption did we make during our proof that limited the equation<span>&#39;</span>s domain to (-1,1)?
In order for proper term-by-term subtraction, both expressions need to have the same number of terms, so if a<sub>1</sub> is left over, a term from the other expression must remain as well!
This idea that n-1=n where n is an infinite number is the basis of many paradoxes, including the famous Banach-Tarski. 
This however is not entirely true, and we can observe this here, at the very source of the mystery. When we subtract, we really get a<sub>1</sub>-a<sub>n</sub>. 
That is, the true formula is <span>&#931;</span>=(a<sub>1</sub>-a<sub>n</sub>)/(1-r).
The assumption is made here: a<sub>n</sub>, which is a<sub>1</sub>r<sup>n-1</sup>, is mathematically irrelevant and equal to its limit zero. 
This leads to amazing results like .99999...=1 exactly, because 0.0000...1 is equal to exactly zero. If |r|<span>&#60;</span>1, then a<sub>n</sub> is indeed mathematically irrelevant. 
However if |r|>1, then a<sub>n</sub> is extremely large and a<sub>1</sub> is in fact mathematically irrelevant! 
Better yet, if r=-1, the two expressions cancel in an alternating fashion and the sum is zero. (This techniaclly violates the nth term test.)
Lastly, you might be tempted to say that if r=1, the expressions cancel exactly and the sum is therefore zero...but be wary of the right side!
<span>&#931;</span>-<span>&#931;</span>*r=0 as well. There are many ways to show that 1+1+1+... is an infinite number.

<br><br>A final note: Infinity is not a number but a condition that can be approached. 
The numbers that satisfy this condition are called the infinite numbers (plural). You cannot have infinity of something; you can only have an infinite number of something. 
One could all of mathematics by redefining real numbers to include the infinite numbers, each in terms of the limit of 1/x as x<span>&#8594;</span>0 to equal one "infinite unit", or <span>&#8733;</span>. 
For example, the limit of 5/x as x<span>&#8594;</span>0 would be 5<span>&#8733;</span>. The importance lies in retaining information, because of the coefficient and a standard base. 
If after some long derivation, the answer comes out to be <span>&#8734;</span>, this can't be compared to other results. 
The current solution is the b-method, but the limit is limiting (no pun intended) because of the sheer uselessness when this limit comes out to <span>&#177;</span>&#8734; itself.
One thing worth investigating is applications of problems where two infinite series of lengths x and y terms (respectively) are added to each other and then contrasted with a series of length x+y.
And of course, there is no shortage of problems that to be reconsidered once convergence is redefined...

<div class="h2" id="rad">Nested Radicals Formula</div>
<div class="text">
Let š(x) signify the square root of x. Given an expression in the form š(a+š(b)) and that a^2-b is a perfect square, the expression can be rewritten without nested radicals as:
š(a+š(a^2-b))/š(2)+š(a-š(a^2-b))/š(2). That is, calculate some variable p=a^2-b and then š(a+š(b)) = š(a+š(p))/š(2)+š(a-š(p))/š(2). I developed this when I found š(2+š(3))/2 to be irksome after using the cosine half-angle formula to find cos(pi/12)- which, by the way, reduces to (š(2)+š(6))/4.
...Coming Soon: š(a-š(b)) for sine

<div class="h2" id="puzzle">Inscribed Circle Puzzle</div>
<div class="text">
<img src="tripuzzle.png" style="float:left">I invented this puzzle to show that a little prudence and cleverness can cut down on a lot of algebra.
A right triangle has leg lengths 5 and 12. Find r, the radius of the inscribed circle. 
<br><br>A running total of three possible solutions besides mine: 1) coordinate geometry, 2) (used by 3 different students) a crazy memorized formula 
from some random high-level mathematics book (r=ab/(a+b+c)), and 3) fragment the triangle into three triangles each with one of the original triangle's 
edges as the base and a radius as the height. My almighty method? Notice three blue, deltoid-shaped regions. The straight edges of each region are equal. 
The smallest has edges of length r. The second largest has edges of length (5-r). The largest has edges of length (12-r). The second largest and largest deltoids each have an edge that lines up to form the hypotenuse, of length 13. 
Here comes the math: (5-r)+(12-r)=13. -2r=-4. r=2. My method is currently the fastest. Coordinate geometry is currently the slowest.

<div class="h2" id="cns">Computer Number Systems</div>
<div class="text">These are part of the computer science club curriculum at Acton-Boxborough because the ACSL requires it. 
The universal number system is decimal, which is in fact rather arbitrary. It seems that base 8 would have been a much better choice. 
The curriculum concerns only four different number systems: binary (base 2), octal (base 8), decimal (base 10), and hexadecimal. 
This is listed here because I found and proved a shortcut to convert between binary, octal, and hexadecimal without turning to decimal. 
I derived basic properties of each system and found each to be self-sustaining with slightly different mechanisms for arithmetic. 
In other words, having chosen 8 over 10 all those years back would not have complicated the way in which we add, multiply, take the log of, etc.
For base n, there are n digits: 0 to n-1. For binary this means just 0s and 1s. For octal, it's 0 to 7. 
For hexadecimal, we have to invent new digits to symbolize the extra six, and the consensus is the following: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F. 
Looking at a number system individually, the basic idea is that as you count, you add to the rightmost digit before the decimal point ("decimal point" is just a name not particularly affiliated with base 10-it keeps its name in any base just for the sake of simplicity) and every place that equals or exceeds the base carries a number over. 
In binary, we begin with 1. We add 1 and get 2, but 2 is never a possible digit in a binary number so we carry it over and write 10...then 11...then carry over and get 100...101, 110, 111, 1000. 
Looking at a number system relative to decimal, each place (for base 10: ones place, tens place, hundreds, etc.) signifies the base to a certain power. 
For decimal the ones place signifies 10^0. The next is 10^1, and then 10^2, then 10^3, and so on. In binary it goes 2^0, 2^1, 2^2...
<br><br>Let's practice with binary-decimal conversions.
Take 7 in decimal. We break it down into 1(2^2)+1(2^1)+1(2^0)=111.
Take 34. The largest power of 2 we can grab is 32, and we break it down from there. 1(2^5) leaves 2. We don't have any 16's, 8's, or 4's, so those three places are zeroes. We have a 2 so we write 1 at that place. We don't have any 1's (obvious conclusion, since we began with an even number) so this place is 0. We have
1(2^5)+0(2^4)+0(2^3)+0(2^2)+1(2^1)+0(2^0)-->100010. Note we could also stick terms onto the beginning and express 34 as 0(2^10)+0(2^9)+0(2^8)+0(2^7)+0(2^6)+1(2^5)+0(2^4)+0(2^3)+0(2^2)+1(2^1)+0(2^0)-->00000100010, but that's like writing 5 in decimal as 00000000000000000000000000005 or 05. Those leading zeroes serve no purpose.
Take 1023. I can already see that it is 1 short of 1024, which 2^10, so I can quickly say that's 10 1's.
