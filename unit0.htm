Non-derived quantity: no expression for definition, expressed in non-derived (basic) units
<br>&#8594;x for distance/displacement, t for time, m for mass, etc.
<br>Rate: expressed as division in definition
<br>&#8594;v for velocity, a for acceleration, P for power, p for momentum, etc.
<br>Derived quantity: expressed as multiplication in definition, usually a capital letter
<br>&#8594;T for period, C for circumference, R for range, F for force, W for work, J for impulse, etc.

<div class="h2">Scalar and Vector</div>
<div class="text">
Distance and speed are scalar. Displacement and velocity are vector. Scalars disregard direction and are the sum of the magnitudes
(always positive, greater than or equal to vector), whereas vectors import both magnitude and orientation. If a plane travels from 
London to Delhi and back, then its displacement is zero because the flight back is negative and cancels out the forward flight, but 
the distance only adds on, no matter which direction. Its distance would simply be its mileage. If it flew in a perfectly straight 
line, the distance would be twice the distance between the two cities. If it swerved left on one trip, it would have to swerve right 
to reach its destination, adding onto its distance, but the sidetracking cancels out for displacement, which simply depends on final and initial.
