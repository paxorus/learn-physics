<div class="h2">Proofs and Derivations</div>
<div class="text">
Throughout 11th and 12th grade, I gained quite an addiction for math. I filled notebooks with just ideas in the forms of proofs and derivations.
They have become a defining characteristic for me- maybe antisocial, maybe intellectual, maybe obsessed, maybe dedicated. All I will say is that I will
always be proud of my extracurricular work in mathematics (as well as other fields) during these two years, and this site is a means of preserving and 
sharing the best of them.

<div class="h2">Drawing and Painting</div>
<div class="text">
As a busybody I never have the patience for drawing and painting, but during 10th grade I took drawing and painting, which was a one of a kind experience.
At the following link I have my favorite pieces. Various styles of drawing are represented, as well as one painting. (I enjoyed drawing far more.)

<div class="h2">Poetry</div>
<div class="text">
I occasionally write poetry. Whenever I want to challenge myself with a certain theme, I sit down and force myself to fit the theme: perhaps rhyming, 
perhaps expressing an image in words, or perhaps incorporating a riddle. The link below will take you straight to Google Drive Viewer.
